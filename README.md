# Learning kinship from face recognition

## Overview
A machine learning project focusing on identifying kinship relationships between pairs of individuals through facial recognition analysis, utilizing the Families In Wild (FIW) dataset.

## Project Structure

### `data/`
The Families In Wild (FIW) dataset and generated CSV files for kinship analysis.

### `preprocess/`
Data preprocessing utilities and dataset organization tools.

### `src/`
Neural network implementations and model outputs.

### `alvis_scripts/`
Example scripts for Chalmers University's Alvis cluster deployment.


Each directory contains its own detailed README with specific documentation.
